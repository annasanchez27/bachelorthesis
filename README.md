# Bachelor thesis
Code used to develop my Bachelor's thesis (Implementation of a multi-layer neural network). It was developed at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) at DTU Fotonik.
The goal of the project is to create a multi-layer neural network from scratch.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
